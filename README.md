# COVID-19 Data Analysis: Trends in Kenya, India, and USA

A brief analysis of COVID-19 data focusing on trends in total cases, daily new cases, and vaccination progress for Kenya, India, and the United States. The project also includes a global choropleth map of total cases.

## Objectives

*   Load and preprocess COVID-19 data from the OWID (Our World in Data) dataset.
*   Filter data for specific countries of interest: Kenya, India, and the United States.
*   Visualize and compare trends in:
    *   Total confirmed cases over time.
    *   Daily new confirmed cases (using a 7-day rolling average for clarity).
    *   Total vaccinations over time.
*   Calculate a basic death rate (Case Fatality Rate) for the selected countries based on the latest available data.
*   Generate a global choropleth map to visualize the distribution of total COVID-19 cases worldwide based on the latest data.

## Tools and Libraries Used

*   **Programming Language:** Python 3.x
*   **Core Libraries:**
    *   **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis (loading CSV, filtering, grouping, etc.).
    *   **Matplotlib:** For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations (line plots).
    *   **Plotly Express:** For creating interactive visualizations (choropleth map).
    *   **(Seaborn):** Imported, but not explicitly used in the final script provided. Can be included if further styling or specific plots are added.
*   **Environment:**
    *   Jupyter Notebook (for interactive development and presentation).
    *   Visual Studio Code (as the IDE for developing the notebook).
*   **Data Source:**
    *   OWID (Our World in Data) COVID-19 dataset (`owid-covid-data.csv`).

## How to Run/View the Project

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
    *   Install the necessary libraries. You can do this using pip:
        ```bash
        pip install pandas matplotlib plotly notebook ipykernel
        ```
        *(Note: `seaborn` can be added to the pip install command if used).*

2.  **Get the Data:**
    *   Download the `owid-covid-data.csv` file from [Our World in Data's GitHub repository for COVID-19 data](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data) or ensure it's present in the same directory as the notebook.

3.  **Open and Run the Notebook:**
    *   Open the project directory in Visual Studio Code or your preferred Jupyter Notebook environment.
    *   Open the `covid_analysis.ipynb` (or your named `.ipynb`) file.
    *   Select a Python interpreter/kernel that has the above libraries installed. VS Code will prompt you if needed.
    *   You can run all cells by clicking "Run All" in the notebook toolbar, or run cells individually in sequence.

4.  **Viewing Outputs:**
    *   The visualizations (line plots and the choropleth map) will be displayed inline within the Jupyter Notebook after the corresponding code cells are executed.
    *   If the `savefig` and `write_html` lines in the code are uncommented, PNG images of the plots and an HTML file for the choropleth map will also be saved to the project directory.

## Insights and Reflections

*(This is where you add your personal observations and thoughts. Here are some prompts and examples to get you started. **You need to fill this section based on your actual findings and experience.**)*

*   **Observed Trends:**
    *   "The analysis showed distinct waves of total cases and new daily cases in all three countries, though the timing and magnitude of these waves varied. For example, [mention a specific observation, e.g., India experienced a significant surge in cases around Spring 2021]."
    *   "Vaccination progress also showed different trajectories, with [mention a specific observation, e.g., the United States showing an earlier ramp-up in vaccinations compared to Kenya]."
    *   "The 7-day rolling average for daily new cases was crucial for smoothing out daily reporting noise and revealing underlying trends more clearly."
    *   "Using a logarithmic scale for total cases and vaccinations was helpful for visualizing growth rates, especially when numbers spanned several orders of magnitude."

*   **Data Challenges/Limitations:**
    *   "The dataset contained missing values, particularly for `total_vaccinations` in earlier periods. While `dropna` was used for critical columns in time-series plots, and `fillna(0)` for others, these methods have implications. For instance, filling `new_cases` with 0 might not always be accurate and could affect averages if done before rolling calculations for periods with truly missing data."
    *   "The calculated 'death rate' is a crude Case Fatality Rate (CFR) and should be interpreted with caution. It doesn't account for lags in reporting deaths, testing rates, or demographic factors, and the true Infection Fatality Rate (IFR) is likely different."
    *   "The 'latest' data for the choropleth map depends on the last update in the dataset and might not represent the absolute current situation for all countries simultaneously."

*   **Project Learnings/Reflections:**
    *   "This project reinforced the importance of data preprocessing, including handling missing data and converting data types, before visualization and analysis."
    *   "Choosing appropriate visualizations for different types of data and questions is key. Line plots were effective for time-series trends, while the choropleth map provided a good geographical overview."
    *   "Working with date-time data in Pandas is a fundamental skill for time-series analysis."
    *   "The transition from a `.py` script to a Jupyter Notebook highlighted the benefits of notebooks for presenting data analysis work, allowing for a clear narrative alongside the code and its outputs."
    *   *(Future work idea): "Future analysis could involve comparing these countries to regional averages, or incorporating other variables like testing rates or hospitalizations if available and clean."*

**To use this:**

1.  Create a new file named `README.md` in the root directory of your project.
2.  Copy the content above and paste it into your `README.md` file.
3.  **Crucially, review and customize the "Insights and Reflections" section** with your own genuine observations from working with the data and creating the notebook. Also, double-check the project title and short description to ensure they accurately reflect your work.
4.  If you used Seaborn for anything, add it to the list of libraries.
5.  Verify the link to the OWID data or specify how you obtained your `owid-covid-data.csv`.
